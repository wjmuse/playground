Jeff, I understand you've been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders 
for some of your transportation work.  Please do not go directly to the 
traders, rather the structuring desk.  Also, please coordinate your activites 
with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight, dealing with all trucking and 
rail issues.  We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of 
the customers you've pitched.  In most cases, we have been covering many of 
these customers from the energy side already.

Thanks for your cooperation

Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the 
gas trading h.r. people with respect to robin menear.  she was listed as 
commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a 
commercial manager.  Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class, even though 
this was a problem at mid year as well.   Of course he told me it had been 
taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over 
her history, and what my intent was when i hired her.  he too was involved in 
the hiring decision.

Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there 
were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial 
team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar 
recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 
contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless 
weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we 
are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting 
function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, 
given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, 
we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be 
accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in 
their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all 
responsibility going forward. 

I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.

markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity

to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

As we begin our summer recruitment process, it is crucial that we continue to 
be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates.  As you know, Enron has 
committed over $1million during the next four years to University of 
Pennsylvania, and Wharton..  I want to make sure we don't limit ourselves in 
getting the Enron message out at Penn and Wharton by restriciting the number 
of summer employees.  I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for 
the summer.  In fact, I'd like to be as aggressive as possible.  I am 
operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have 
positions, we will offer all of them summer jobs.  I will not accept the 
notion of only 1 summer associate, and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts.

In addition, I'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $200 gift 
certificates is viewed as good one.  I'm not sure that is a good use of 
Enron's dollars, and would like to know what other events we are planning for 
the sell weekends.

Dear Larry,

Thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday.  
Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add 
even more value as we explore your basis risks.  I've asked Mark Tawney, 
Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly 
linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities.  
His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge 
research.  

We didn't have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but 
I'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate 
relationship.  If there is anything else I can do, please call. 

It's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier.  
Again thanks for your time.

Thanks for the email.  Actually, you are completely wrong about my view of 
Joe.  He has tremedous integrity, and is a very strong team builder, and has 
added much value to our organization.  I was however a little surprised by 
your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position.  I would 
have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind 
of capacity here, or in london, or elsewhere if you liked.  In addition, I 
could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products.  
(Which I will remind you about frequently)

I'm sure your decision will prove valuable to Joe, and hopefully to you as 
well.  Mike and I would like to see you back on the A-team though--we both 
respect your business sense.

okay-i have a question-have you heard anything about a new group in Broadband 
that will be trading commercial air time?
I believe it involves Edward Andarza and some other guy named Ben Freeman. I 
thought it might be of interest to someone with 
a communications background, that purchased television air time.....

for a loop too.  Oh, your message got to me this morn.  Please don't ever

We are pleased to announce the following within EGM:

The Convertible Bond Arbitrage desk will be moving from EnronCredit.com to 
the Equity desk under Gary Hickerson, and will be managed by Mike Bradley.  
Billy Lemmons has joined Gary Hickerson's unit as well.  He is exploring the 
agriculture value chain and outlining our risk management, (What else here?)

Dan Reck will be transitioning out of the coal group and will be exploring 
our rail and trucking initiatives.  These markets together represent 
approximately $105 billion notionally, and we believe there are many 
synergies between our energy, coal, and freight trading businesses.  In 
addition, we have asked (Pierre Aury to run our worldwide vessel trading 
businesses.  Scott Moncrief will be responsible for all liquids vessel 
businesses reporting to Pierre)  (should we mention cement here under george 
mclellan?)

Our worldwide weather operations will continue to report to Mark Tawney in 
Houston, and he will have all V@R  allocation responsibility between Sydney, 
Tokyo, Oslo, and Houston.  In addition we will be forming a weather marketing 
desk in London.

Janelle Scheuer will be joining the Global Products from Enron America's East 
power origination group, and is responsible for developing a mid-market 
business specifically for our liquids businesses.  She will be reporting to 
John Nowlan.  Bill White will be coming over from EBS and has responsiblity 
for all U.S. financial crude trading.  Don Schroeder will continue to have 
oversight of our physical crude business.

Hi guys.  

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the 
Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, 
and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside 
Wharton/Penn recruiting.  In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from 
Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons.  This 
program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost 
a lot of momentum over the last two years.

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't  in 
its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been 
addressing.  The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams 
are not lending support to the program.  I'd be very happy to spend a few 
minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my 
overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.  

You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has 
gotten me to my rope's end with the program.",0

Hi John

Things are heating up for year end keeping us all pretty busy.  As we go 
forward in many of our businesses, it's clear several need fine tuning.  One 
of which is weather worldwide.  Mark Tawney and I have spent quite a bit of 
time during the last several weeks working on a plan for next year and 
forward.  We've come to the conclusion that it will be most effective to add 
a London operation that will allow for quick and beneficial marketer 
interaction, immediate scalability, and more portfolio diversification.  I 
would structure the business around the continent with someone managing that 
portion of the operation, and continue to have Thor manage Scandinavia.  Mark 
and I will get together to structure the London based group and keep you 
advised.  

Mark has some great ideas, and I'd like to talk to you about this rather than 
go on in an email.  I'll give you a ring first thing in the morning.  

Best--

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time 
dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather 
business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become 
full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I 
will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by 
this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important 
that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be 
in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the 
weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations 
and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide 
powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure.",0
114,"
As we move forward with our global LNG strategy, it is obvious that the best 
way to capture value for Enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this 
business unit.  This merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position 
management from a worldwide perspective.  Our ability to gather data and to 
show only one Enron face in the market is crucial to our success.  As 
important is one pricing desk.  Many of you know, Eric Groves in Houston is 
running our pricing desk, Larry Lawyer is working on all finance type 
business for us, and Jen Fraser is running our fundamentals group.  

To bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide LNG business, Mike and I 
wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention.  ALL LNG 
contacts, negotiations, and contracts, (physical, financial, buys, sales, 
etc.), with external counterparties must and will be managed through our 
commercial LNG group headed by Eric Gonzales, and Rick Bergsieker.  

It is crucial to manage market perspective, appearance, and informantion.  We 
all know how important each project (Metgas, and other initiatives in India) 
could be, but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our 
businesses.

Hi, hope you are doing great.  I was wondering if you've met Russell Dyke, 
who is in Lagrasta's group, and who I told could get into the LNG before you 
came over.  He has great international experience, and LNG experience.  He 
might be a great match with the Jose team, since I'm uncomfortable with their 
understanding of MTM, and their overall appreciation of the Enron way of 
doing business.  (Today, Russel (assoc/mgr at year end) closed a deal with 
CSFB worth 19 million to us.)  Overall a solid guy.   Let me know what you 
think.  (Merritt and Russell know each other well, and have worked on 
projects together)

Also, I mentioned to Merritt that I was excited about her opportunity to 
trade dutch power, but was very interested in staying in touch with her, 
possibly to trade freight, etc.

Looks like there is plenty of work to do, and I continue to believe shipping,

etc.  One point is that it is our policy not to speak to the press without it

statements, interviews, and the like through the proper channels going

the California University system).  Jeremy Blachman and I are going to run

Hi Lea, 

What are you thinking about with Jeff (Koons)?  

Jeff",0
130,"
It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  

Thanks.   Jeff",0

I don't know why I got a new P&L DPR at 2:30 today showing a change in P&L

Don's Var went up 2.8 million to 9.7 million, and Dave's Var went down only

We need to be under our Var tonight.  Dave and Don--please take care of

Thanks for the video conference this morning.  Mike and I are convinced 
weather can and will be an extremely profitable business.  One issue I would

I'd like to find out more about it, and in relation to the work Tom Gros in 
doing in NetWorks.  I'd also like to understand more about the scalability of 
this model, and our relationship with Kiodex.

We are please to announce the following within Enron Global Markets:

Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to start our new 
finance origination activities.  In this role, he will work with all 
commodity products, assets,  and teams and lever our existing businesses with 
new this new focus.  (Do you want to put in his background--which you 
probably now more than I?)  He will be reporting to the Office of the 
Chairman.

Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick 
Bergsieker.  We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG 
markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity.  (Do you want to put in 
his background?)  Rick will be relocating to Dubai, and bring his martket 
relationships and  industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project 
Dolphin (do we want to say this?) and other related Mideast projects.  Eric 
and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman.  

Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all 
products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet 
pages exist today.  Previously, Jen was working in the Mid Market origination 
group.  Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial 
interface for our intranet page.  Heather was with Azurix, where she worked 
on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives. 

Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable.  This group will be 
comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management 
businesses.  This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics 
important to their individual markets, and discuss other  markets in a macro 
sense.  We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group.  In this 
group, traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability 
will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a 
bias toward structural shifts in markets.  This group will not be involved in 
customer activity, and will execute through our principal desks.   Gary will 
manage this new group, as well as continuing with his current F/X, Rates, 
Equity, and Agriculture initiatives.

Thanks for your interest.  Of course I remember our conversation.  By now I'm 
sure you know you are on our interview list.  (If I told you prematurely, use 
it to your advantage somehow with your friends.)  I've contacted one of our 
head broadband marketers to set up an introduction, and see where this goes.  
It's a great idea, and you should hear back from me shortly, when David 
responds to me call.  

Best regards,

Jeff

P.S.  Please call me Jeff--I'm not some grey haired old dude, but I 
appreciated your being professional in your first email to me.

Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and

approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the 
nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and 
the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will 
be managed.

Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% 
year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct 
group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate 
allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be 
able to achieve this goal?

Regards
Delainey",1

David, I don't know if you are the right person to speak with; however, I am 
looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related 
cost allocations to ENA for 2001.  We have been given allocation projections 
that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.  I would like to know how this 
was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions.

If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you 
please pass this on to the right spot.

Regards
Dave Delainey",1

Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than 
doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could 
you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense 
groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.

Regards
Delainey",1
9,"
Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.

Guys, I would like you to consider the following people to provide the basis 
of your producer marketing team.  They are being re-deployed out of the 
upstream services group and have significant experience and relationships in 
the producer services market segment.  They can provide mid-market coverage, 
producer outsourcing, well-head purchases, etc.  As per our previous 
discussion, these folks will be your producer team and will provide all ENA's 
products to the segment.  Please keep this confidential - but please speak 
with Jean Mrha.

The names include:
 Linda Roberts - director - lead the central region;
 Mary Jo Johnson - manager - central region (wait until post HPL sale);

 Jill Zivley - director -  lead the east region;
 Gary Bryan - director - east region;
 Jennifer Martinez - manager - east region;
 Bill Brogan - manager - east region;
 Kreg Hall - analyst - east region;
 Brian Riley - director - east region (wait until post HPL sale).

Both Brian and Mary Jo are inside HPL and if sold would interview with the 
buyer first and then would be available for ENA - lets wait on these folks 
until post sale.  Lets make a strong effort to accomodate these folks given 
their experience and availability.

Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a 
reasonable cut-off before this turns into an All-Employee meeting at the 
Hyatt.  John and I decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large 
visable budgets.  In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg 
for mid market and yourself for origination.

I hope this rationale will manage your issues.  If we invite Jake I think you 
do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room.

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave",1

By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you 
with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very 
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.  
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing, 
our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.  

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry 
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) 
at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a 
success.


Sincerely,


Dave

Guys, as part of the new A&A program being rolled out by the ENE Office of 
the Chair, a new Associate and Analyst PRC is being set up.  I have nominated 
you as the six people from ENA to be on this PRC.  You will represent ENA's 
A&A's and participate in the evaluation and ranking across the entire 
company.  This is a very important function - please represent us well.

Jeff, as per our discussion, this would be a great opportunity for you to 
spend some time with and instill your vision for Enron to the leaders of the 
ENA organization.  I have attached a preliminary agenda which has you 
speaking to the group right after dinner the night of December 14th.  You 
have no time constraint on the length of your talk (ie) whatever you find 
find appropriate in order to get your message across.  I though it might be 
interesting for you to give your vision of Enron's 2001 goals, objectives and 
strategy.  As well, a brief business overview of EES, EBS and Networks may be 
valuable in building connections.

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.  
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two 
day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be 
discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian 
in Las Vegas.

This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard 
and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage 
everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we 
would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.

ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.

Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.

I need ASAP-- South America is going home & they are off tomorrow ----Thank=
s,=20
kay


On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=
n,=20
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=
t=20
are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=
=20
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=
=20
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=
;=20
however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =
will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=
=20
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=
=20
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=

Guys, I spoke with Mark this morning.  He is very supportive of the structure 
and idea.  I had indicated that he would continue to run the producer 
services business in the West but would also be part of the overall team as 
we plot out strategy in the West.  He wants to stay in Denver which I think 
we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into 
the overall team.  I had indicated that we would consolidate market making 
into Houston and Paul Lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or 
not - if so he needs to move to Houston.

 Phillip/Barry, go ahead and start working with Mark as you develop your 
plans going forward.  I will be speaking to Stephanie Miller this week and 
will give the green light with her shortly.

Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your 
capabilities better than ours.  

In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, 
part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric 
contract.  The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW 
of power.  I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all 
their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP 
controls in the nation.

The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.  I spoke to him 
yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.  Joe is 
a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like 
the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.  It may be a good 
lead into the health care segment.

Regards
Delainey ",1

Eric, as per my discussion with Rob, I believe that the site has the most 
value to us given its location and capability.  I would continue to actively 
develop that site for a variety of turbine technologies.  As far as the 
turbines, I would probably exit them in the most opportune manner.

Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board 
meetings and PRC's.

Lets set up this discussion with the following points:
 a) we are not exiting Argentina;
 b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business 
opportunity;
 c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate 
intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater 
productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision 
making and greater communication;
 d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer 
coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and
 e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao 
Paulo.

Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and 
origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources 
based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs 
wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong 
presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural 
issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that 
you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina 
- its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business 
model we are trying to move forward.

Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these 
ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and 
Orlando as part of this process.

Regards

Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern 
Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain 
strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of 
this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory 
pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis 
markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward 
characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, 
there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA 
point of view.

The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.  
The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.  
the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, 
venture capital and the ""organizing group"" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he 
believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million 
of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to 
participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.

Guys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $100M in 
nominal value):
  a) 2 power barges - Brian - $13M
  b) 2 ABB 11N1 - Rob- $35M
  c) 1 501D5A - Janet/Chris - $25M
  d) 1 7EA - Janet/Chris- $20M

All other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects.  
Could you please provide me your plan with these units.  I would like to

Rick, I have been having discussions with both Joe Deffner and Jean Mrha on 
this one.  Clearly, this is a commercial banking product in which we have 
little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or 
collateral (reserve risk).  Ultimately, I have challenged the Upstream Group 
to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this 
increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness.

Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective 
communication tool.  

I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our 
settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of 
communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I 
have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the 
larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm 
pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have 
suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both 
TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are 
going.  

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.

I am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting.  I just 
think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with 
families.  The drive to Galveston and back - the overnight babysitter - the 
potential trouble that may result in close quarters and hours of drinking et 
al.  I prefer the original idea at Enron Field.

Jeff, this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical

no more 6B's or barges.

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust

David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH.  
Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the 
reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant 
recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and 
infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given 
the possible recovery of this sector?  

The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy 
prices.

Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?

Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want 
to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring. 

Regards
Delainey",1
73,"
Jeff, I think we should take a quick review of the existing PI portfolio to 
see where we are and where we want to go - we have with the completion of 
FCEL made a tremedous amount of investment in a very short period of time 
>$60 to $80M.  I would like to  hear how we are moving to monetize more 
mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage 
investments.  I don't want to approve any further investments until we have 
had such a discussion.

Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I 
think it works welll in allocating resources between competing ""going 
concerns"" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses 
that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the 
cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than 
the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often 
clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly 
effectively.

Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of 
time on this.

Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up 
with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on 
Wednesday.  Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so 
that we can ensure that we are comparing ""apples to apples"".  I would also 
suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers.  
It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as 
Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties 
settlement offer.

Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward 
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Randall, I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved.  
It was a pleasure to meet you and your team.

The several things on my radar screen with Bridgeline include:
 a) improving the financial performance of the entity;
 b) ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure 
matches ENA's technology, structure, systems, accountability and policies in 
every manner.  In my view, this is not a negotiable item and will only 
benefit Bridgeline on a go forward basis;
 c) continue to move from the ""heavy lifting"" approach to becoming the 
""smartest pipe"" that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your 
people, your information advantage and I believe somewhat of a first mover 
advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors 
(ie) Entergy/Koch/FPL. We will be very supportive of innovative and 
aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined; and
 d) increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in Bridgeline.

My time and resources are at your disposal.

point of view and to be on side before the investment is made.

Regards
Delainey",1
93,"
Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will 
better reflect my thinking around this investment.  The current text suggests 
that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in 
the fund.  I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in 
the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would 
suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:

 It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an 
effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant   
investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is 
important for the following reasons:
  a) provides an additional ""Friend of Enron"" to facilitate short to medium 
term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity 
and capital transactions in the wholesale group;
  b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and
  c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral 
benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.

ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor 
and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.

Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not 
execute the gas balancing arrangement.  The parties should continue to 
operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute 
the agreement or put it in the data room.  We should represent to potential 
buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have 
been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market.

All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities 
(including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) 
will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC.

Guys, gas with a $5.00 handle is not a good thing for this deal - I know we 
are pushing this restructuring as fast as we can; however, I think we need to 
determine how to move this faster. Any ideas?

Janelle, I was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your 
thoughts on your current role.  I have heard you are considering global fuels 
and Lagrasta's business.  I would like to give you my perspective on the 
future vision for power and the overall organization including gas 
mid-market.  

Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to 
manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself 
the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the 
primary growth engine for Enron Corp over the next several years.

Kay, can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience.

It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality 
flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well 
as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in 
ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your 
respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in 
the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your 
respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an 
informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:

Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other 
departments
Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted 
Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a 
presentation.  The first ""brownbag"" will take place September 8 between 
12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.

Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which 
does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this 
is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in 
seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation 
company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 
2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via 
the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current 
SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency 
power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.  
The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets 
that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and 
constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.  

The benefits include:
 a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the 
opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the 
possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, 
Capstone and Elektryon;
 b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe 
that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize 
this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer 
applications;
 c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of 
critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this 
venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in 
our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk;
 d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital 
would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology 
did not work or the market did not materialize;
 e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology;
 and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.

However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other 
Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company 
and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the 
technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful 
application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.

Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a 
very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of 
the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently 
operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering 
expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause 
at a fixed number for their 50% .

If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I 
will set up a meeting.

Delainey",1

Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an 
interim authority, expires today.  Given current market conditions, I would 
request  an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an 
additional two weeks starting today.

Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional 
permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta 
PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the 
winter season.  I will take your lead on this one.

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent 
with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power 
business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As 
part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and 
decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, 
this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic 
direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a 
pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon 
starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The 
Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The 
meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, 
staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on

I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this 
memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.


As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.",1

coordinate a meeting between Mark Muller/Lou Pai and himself.  I only want 
Lou going up if Tom is involved.  However, Mark Muller is up to go and I have 
spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today.  He is expecting your 
call.

On a related note, I volunteered Wes Colwell (our controller and former 
Anderson person) to speak to Peoples accounting/ risk people and Anderson 
auditors on how to manage the issues surrounding marking the hub values 
inside Peoples.  I would appreciate you coordinating that meeting.  If Wes 
goes to Chicago, we want to ensure Leubbers, the Anderson folks and the 
appropriate Peoples accounting folks are available so Wes can spend the least 
amount of time on this issue.

Jeff, where are we on the PECO/PSEG retail play that you spoke to Mark Muller 
about a couple weeks back?

Mark, I forgot to mention that FPL is interested in potentially investing in 
the New Power Company - Tony Altman (President of FPL wholesale) would like 
to discuss.  If interested please call him at 561-625-7777.  If you don't

As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.

Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a 
list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.  The goal would be to have a 
definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could 
be acted upon.

 a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.;
 b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day 
and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.;
 c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 
5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.;
 d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel ""header"" - Jean M.;
 e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and 
contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.;
 f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - 
working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al 
- Patrick   W.
 
 I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to 
determine a final action plan.

Max, congrats on the Decero PPA - we need to wrestle up another 100 to 200 
MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per 
Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run 
with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the 
Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your 
resources?

On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M 
negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does 
this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we 
managed the position in a very effective manner.

Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a 
necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, 
should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors 
on these boards?

Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti 
is putting plan in place.

Sorry about the confusion.  Fran Mayes will be sending a memo out in the next

Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with 
Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the 
aborted IPO.  His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months 
ago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are 
expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention 
significant increases in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the 
$600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve 
growth and current energy prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to 
demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and 
reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a 
significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.  The 
concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a 
very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable 
strategy to maximize the exit value).

I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points:
 a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and
 b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.

Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to 
sell tha asset.

I hope this meets with your approval.

Regards
Delainey

Yes, we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of Enron Field 
and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for 
your schedule).  I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I 
was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in 
her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it 
done.  I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend.  
However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not 
bring up the attachment.   Can you try that again and check with Patti to 
make sure she has it in readable form?  I will be in London all of next week, 
and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and 
dinner.  I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.  I don't know whether 
or not you included that on your list.  

Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!  I wonder if that 
could be a problem on the 31st?  You never know with Houston weather.  What 
do you think?  We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 
blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned 
by Irma's son, Luis).  

I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure 
that plans are progressing on this.   We will include our recent OU grads as 
well.  

I will save your championship game souvenirs and give them to you when I see 
at the end of January.  --Sally ",2

Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I 
was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at 
that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:

 review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London 
books to same day,

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your 
business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep 
reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to 
continually improve the process), 

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office 
related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR

 do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around 
potential commercialization of  mid and back office services

 
In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you 
think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael 
Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also 
spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan 
to meet with Fernley as well.  

Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?

I hope that your holidays were wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the week of 
vacation that I took before Christmas.  It was fun to be home with the 
children, although I certainly worked hard -- up every night until very late 
either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas 
cards.  

I plan to be in the London office next week.  I will leave Houston on Sunday 
evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.  After a stop by the hotel, 
I should be in the office after lunch.  I plan to be there through Thursday, 
and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.  

I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.  Some of the 
major goals for the trip are:

 to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of 
London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 for managers and above within 
Operations for EA, EGM and EIM),

 to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the 
London office who will participate in  Doorstep reviews this year, 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

I also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our 
operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and 
other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office 
services.  Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like 
for me to meet.  

Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy.  
Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for 
a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this 
week.  

I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.  In addition, 
I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.  Also, if 
you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.  I have been in the 
throws of bonus allocations this week, but hope that today I can start to 
finalize my calendar for next week.  --Sally ",2

I hope that each one of you will arrange your schedules tomorrow to make the 
time to vote.  Also, please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time 
to vote tomorrow.   For those employees who typically work later hours, 
please suggest that they take the time to vote before coming to the office.  
Everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote 
count.  It should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening.  
Hopefully, we will have all played a part in the outcome.  ",2

I plan to work out of the London office during the week of January 15.  I 
will leave Houston on Sunday and will be in the London office starting around 
noon on Monday.  I will be back in the Houston office on Monday, January 22.  
The primary goals of the trip are:

  to work with Mike Jordan on an action plan to move the close and 
officialization of London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 per my e:mail to you for 
managers and above within Operations),

 to hold a training session for business controllers in the London office who 
will participate in Doorstep   reviews this year (outside EEL), 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

 Patti Thompson (x39106) will have a detailed itinerary in hand if you need 
to reach me at any time next week.  ",2

Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer 
to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any 
suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another 
spot besides 47 Park?  

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the 
office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time 
to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally ",2

Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!  Meagan called this afternoon 
to tell me the news.  I will perhaps get more details when I get home

Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special 
information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron 
Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus 
on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the 
location for the meeting will be sent to you early this week.  

I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things

I just composed a somewhat lengthy e:mail about the anniversary trip, and 
then closed out Lotus Notes and checked discard changes.  So it is gone - but 
not sent!!  Can you e:mail me back your office phone number and if it is 
convenient for you, I will give you call and use old fashioned technology.  ",2

I know that you left a message with Patti about contacting David Eastlake.  I 
have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not 
get a message about undeliverable e:mail.  I haven't heard back from him.  
The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.  
I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they 
would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better 
contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before 
Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any 
students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week 
again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to 
Austin early.  

Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I 
did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will 
try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to 
school early.  

I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was 
a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased.  
(Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have 
an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his 
understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few 
minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you. 

Since full-time offers were changed, did we appropriately change summer 
intern offers as well?  I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that.  
Let me know.  --Sally  ",2

Sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently.  Congratulations on 
the baby!  I hope that you are feeling well.  I am so happy for you and your 
husband.  My how your lives will change!!  But how enriched they will be.  
Our three are so much fun.  I will also always be honest with expectant moms 
and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it 
sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience.   If you ever want 
some funny stories about adjusting to being a first-time mom, just let me 
know.  I would be glad to share my experience with you.  --Sally ",2

I am sure that you are enjoying your break from school.  It is always great 
to have finals behind you and several weeks of vacation stretching in front 
of you. 

No doubt you are spending time thinking about your next step after 
graduation.  I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about 
your offer while you are going through that process.  Enron had a fantastic 
year in 2000, and we are excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  We 
hope that you will be a part of that. 

My number at work is 713-853-5926.  Please feel free to call me any time.  If 
it is more convenient for you to talk during the evening or on the weekend, 
my home number is 281-370-8568.  Don't hesitate to call.

I hope that you are enjoying your break from school, and am sure that it is 
even more enjoyable with that Number 1 ranking decided!  My husband (an OU 
grad) and I were at Orange Bowl, and it was really exciting to be there and 
see the team absolutely stop FSU.  

If you have any questions regarding your job offer from Enron while you are 
on vacation, please give me a call.  2000 was a banner year for us at Enron, 
and we were excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  I hope that you 
will join us and be a part of that.  

My office number is 713-853-5926.  If it is more convenient for you, feel 
free to call me at home as well.  That number is 281-370-8568.

I would like to invite each of you to participate in a brainstorming session 
with me on Friday, January 12 from 8:30 am through lunch.  The purpose of 
this meeting will be to surface and capture ideas around the potential 
commercialization of mid and back office services that we provide.  I know 
that many of you have ideas about services and/or products that could be 
marketed and some of you have been involved in arrangements where we have or 
are currently providing services to outside parties.  While there are efforts 
underway with certain modules under CommodityLogic, I want this session to be 
used to take a broader look at how we might market mid and back office 
services.  I hope that you will be able to attend.  

Details on location of the meeting and more exact timing will be sent to you 
on Monday when Patti returns from vacation.   ",2

Thursday, January 4.  

My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has phone numbers where I can be 
reached.  Please contact Bob Hall at x36956 with any questions while I am 
out.  ",2

Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000 
accomplishments.   You should find that when you return to the office.  Let 
me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another 
delivered.  

Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill 
team perform - and also watching some of the game.  Thankfully, no emotional 
attachment to either team in that game!  I just hope that we don't freeze.

I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent 
Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.  Those appeared to be the only names that 
you included for which you wanted my input.  Somehow, from Andrea's voice 
mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I 
thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP.  
Those weren't  on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to know 
that I have responded to the three that were there.  If there was intent for 
me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system. (Believe 
me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP 
as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).  --Sally ",2

Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for 
shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the 
office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus 
information.)  

I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally ",2

Unfortunately, I will miss your farewell at Slick Willie's on January 3rd.  I 
am sorry that I won't be able to drink a beer with you as a send off, but 
perhaps we can have one in London later in January as your welcome to 
London.  I will be in Miami on January 3rd, hopefully celebrating an Oklahoma 
win in the Orange Bowl earlier that day.  David found us tickets to the 
game.  Not great seats, but they are in the stadium.  Hey, it's not UT, but 
it should still be fun to go.  

I will miss you and your wit and constructive cynisism in Houston.  But I 
know that I can count on you to be just as vocal from London!  I plan to be 
there at least quarterly in 2001, and will definitely welcome your first hand 
observations on operational areas that may need attention.  Hopefully between 
e:mail and voice mail we can definitely keep in touch.  

Tell Ann that I hope that this will be a great adventure for her and the 
whole family.  I think that it is a wonderful time in your children's lives 
to give them this experience.    Have fun -- and set them straight!! ",2

wait until I have written documentation of final results in front of me

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.

With a small group, your talk can be informal and you do not need to prepare 
slides (unless you would like to do so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key 
speaking points that would enforce the value of this conference for this 
group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 
your support for global standards for operational controls for trading 
activities
your recognition of the value of operational professionals in the 
organization to ensure integrity of mid and back office functions  
your challenge to the group to strive for best in class processes and 
controls as Enron's growth as a trading organization continues

Let me know if you have any questions and thanks again for joining us.

America, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband 
Services and Enron Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, 
Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York (metals business-maybe!).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.

The group would like to hear about Enron's performance, your outlook for the 
remainder of 2000 and into 2001, your viewpoint on the future of the company 
and next growth opportunities, etc.  With a small group, your talk can be

the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure 
integrity in mid and back office functions

the importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for 
Enron (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that) 

the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to ""raise 
the flag"" on issues if needed

Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.  As speakers were 
confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the 
speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those 
speakers.  Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, 
drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.  We have 
arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy 
chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a 
means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.  This 
can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  

The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement 
of our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short 
""state of the union of operations"" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and 
EEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, 
discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  

Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in 
which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of 
operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could 
have such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the 
afternoon.  

Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move 
Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and 
lessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going 
project.  

Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool 
for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  

We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its 
impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted 
Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  

Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles 
Center Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are 
waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  

Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.  
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal 
presentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will 
be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action 
steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information 
provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office 
services within Enron.  

Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.  
Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.  
After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to 
reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against 
our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  

Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.  The only details still 
in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's 
attendance.

set up today.  As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under 
Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.  This is in addition to my role within

The Associates PRC was completed on Monday, July 24.  As the PRC rep, I will 
communicate the final ranking from the PRC process to your supervisor.  I 
received a copy of the rankings from Charlene on Friday while I was on

supervisor today.  It is your supervisor who will the one be to give you your

We have a new date - Monday, July 24th beginning at 9:00 am.  I will contact

Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name 
and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in 
Houston.  My extension is 35926.

do.  I am also sending an e:mail message to the Associates that I am

I will serve as a representative to the  Associates PRC meeting that will 
take place on July 19.  As a PRC rep, I have been assigned the Associates to 
represent in the meeting as indicated on the attachment.  The Associates 
Program has provided me  with your name as the PRC supervisor of the 
associate as listed.  

 

Please provide me with the following by Friday, July 14:   

Associate's accomplishments for the first half of 2000 (prepared by the 
associate or summarized by you) 

Description of associate's current responsibilities/assignment (and any 
additional rotational assignments during this first six months of the year) 

Pre-ranking of the associate from your business unit PRC , or your suggestion 
on ranking if no business unit PRC process has been completed (Superior, 
Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues) 

Any other information that you believe will be helpful in accurately 
representing the associate in the PRC process

Recommendation for promotion, if any 

I will receive a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor Feedback from the PEP 
system through the Associates Program.  

I will be on vacation until Monday, July 17.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, 
will be contacting you next week to ask if you would like to meet with me for 
a few minutes on Monday or Tuesday, July 17 and 18 (or phone call) to discuss 
your associate and his/her performance in more detail.  

Thanks for your attention to this.  If you are not the appropriate PRC 
supervisor for the associate listed on the attachment,  please reply by 
e:mail as soon as possible and my assistant will research where I should go 
next for this input.

I hope that your holiday was wonderful.  Nikki told me that you would be 
working from home today, but I decided not to bother you there.  I will try 
to have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.  I 
start with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30 
to about 7:15. 

I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.  I don't 
think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of 
June 27.  Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?  I have scheduled 
dinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the 
trip.  Just let me know.  Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?  

Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG 
acquisition.  That should make life fun for you!  I wanted to talk about 
resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence 
efforts and longer term in the assimilation.  As in my voice mail, I believe 
that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a 
controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they 
run their business.  It seems that might help jump start the plans around how 
best to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, 
as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already 
been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and 
in other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who 
seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the 
names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is 
unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can 
hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.    ",2

Hope your long weekend was a good one, uneventful on Monday, at least.  Got 
your message last Friday.  It seems as if Kristin is more and more interested 
in the EBS role, especially after her continuing discussions with Jim 
Fallon.  The timing of her trip to London is somewhat up in the air.  May be 
the end of this week, may be next week.  I think it will still be good for 
you and Kristin to talk in person.  Kristin and Todd are both very qualified 
and you would love working with both.  Kristin's established working 
relationship with Jim Fallon would definitely be a plus.  I don't want to 
lose both of them from ENA, however, at the same
 time.  So I would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.  

I got your message on housing/location in Houston.  I am headed out of the 
office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ENA's Office of the Chairman.  I 
will call you on Friday when I am back in the office and talk through some 
options on housing.  ",2

Thanks for the Pappa's gift certicate.  For a woman who can't remember the 
last time that she cooked dinner, this will come in very handy!  Thanks, too, 
for the beautiful flower arrangement that has graced my desk for the past two 
days.  I will take that home with me tonight and I will enjoy it during my 
upcoming days off.  

I hope that the Christmas holiday brings each of you the joy of the season -- 
and some rest, relaxation and time with family and friends.  Thanks for your 
enthusiasm in your role at Enron and for your continuing and tireless 
effort.  It is through working with each one of you that I find my job to be 
fun.  1999 was a year of outstanding accomplishments for Energy Operations - 
a direct result of your contributions.  I look forward to meeting new 
challenges in 2000 through continuing to work together.      ",2

Crazy week -- 7:00 pm and I just finished a project for Delainey that I got 
at noon today.  Cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed 
ever since.  Patti gave me your message with your home number around 5:30 
today, just as she was leaving -- apologized for not giving it to me 
earlier.  However, given my immediate project, I don't think that I could 
have called until now.  And at 1:00am London time, I think that this e:mail 
is much better.  

I am still really crunched tomorrow morning.  All of our mid-year reviews 
must be completed by the time we have our ENA Office of the Chair staff 
meeting at 2:30 tomorrow.  Big push, after an over percentage completion rate 
of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.  Some of those unfinished 
reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).  I wrote three 
last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:00 am and gave all three 
reviews this morning.  I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver 
tomorrow morning to be at 100%.  I will try to call you on my way into the 
office tomorrow morning from the car.  If I miss you then, it will be late 
afternoon Houston time before I could call you.  Next week shapes up to be 
MUCH better.  

I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.  Would love 
to have to over here and involved in operations.  So I will either catch you 
from my car tomorrow morning, or we can talk on Monday.  ",2

I scheduled this meeting in Houston to best accomodate schedules of some of 
our Enron speakers -- the hill country or even Galveston was going to make it 
impossible for Jeff Skilling to join us.  I would look at this meeting as if 
it were to be held outside of town.  I have preliminarily reserved rooms for 
all of you at the Wyndham Warwick.  Part of the reason for this forum is to 
meet and get to know your counterparts in other Enron operating companies and 
from around the world.  If you can stay at the hotel, this team building will 
probably be enhanced.  This memo is not to force you to pack your bags and 
stay at the hotel, but to let you know that my budget for the event did 
include rooms for all of you for Sunday and Monday nights.  I hate the Sunday 
thing, but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who 
will travel from far away, this best suited their schedules.  Please let 
Patti know on Thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to 
make it easier for you to fully participate.  ",2

It is with regret that I have accepted Steve Jackson's letter of resignation 
from Enron.  Steve has made a choice to leave Enron and to join another 
company in the industry.  I know that you will join me in thanking him for 
his many years of service to Enron and the contributions that he has made.  
His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed, as 
will his leadership on the gas team.  Although Steve's official last day with 
the company is in two weeks, today is his last day in the office.  He will be 
available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you 
may have on any open items that you were covering with Steve.  Patti has his 
home number if you need that.  We will also plan a happy hour for Steve and 
we will let you know when and where that will take place.  

Effective tomorrow, Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk 
group, reporting to me.  Jeff will join Bob Hall and Leslie Reeves as 
business controllers for Natural Gas, to continue to work together to provide 
leadership for the processes, controls, people and systems that support all 
aspects of this key business for North America.  Please join me in 
congratulating Jeff on his new responsibilities.   ",2

While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.  ",2

Hope are things in London?  I have seen Beth Apollo at two meetings in Texas 
recently, one in Dallas and one in San Antonio.  We have been making the 
Texas circuit -- not quite as exciting as your travels.  

I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at 
the end of October/beginning of November.  She will be interviewing students 
at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston 
from Wesneday, November 1 to Saturday, November 4.  They will be staying with 
us at our house.  It will be fun to watch Tyler and Rebecca get to know one 
another!  She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well.  By the 
way, Stephanie is expecting baby number two -- I think that when she is here 
she will be about six months pregnant.  

I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off 
chance that you might be in Houston at that time.  It would be fun for all of 
us to get together.  I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has 
joined Enron and this week I saw another old First City banker, Jeff Baker, 
who was on his first day here.  We could also schedule a First City reunion 
if you could be here.  If it doesn't work this time, just let me know the 
next time you will be in Houston and I will round up all the usual suspects 
for a lunch or happy hour.  

I may need to head to London in October or November.  I will let you know if 
my travel plans develop.  

I hear from Beth that you have taken a very adventurous vacation -- mountain 
climbing!!!!!!!  How was it?  I will be anxious to hear.  --Sally

Invitations have been mailed to all VP's and above for the annual Enron 
Management Conference to be held at the Hyatt Hill Country in San Antonio 
November 15-17.  Hopefully, you have received your invitation (more to save

your invitation, please let me know.  ",2

It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I appreciated 
your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.  I am sure 
that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody and Nate 
participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have done a 
great job in changing and promoting the program.  

I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer 
interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware of 
the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully with a 
change in our strategy! 

If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We 
will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets may 
already be sold.  

On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of 
compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school 
shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get 
merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know 
-- we can probably place a few orders through you!  ",2

As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of 
Directors.  Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.  In 
conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily 
report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston 
time) to let me know about this requirement.  Obviously, we want to meet 
Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete 
as possible.  Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over 
the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be 
excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are 
very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send 
to the daily 8:30 meeting.)  

I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh 
and me at 4:00 today.  Realizing that the time was very late in London, we 
tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in 
the meeting.  Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that 
Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.  

Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R 
calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.  The 
Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing 
an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this 
timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by 
approximately 10:00 am Houston time.  


Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R 
including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) 
will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston 
time (10:00 am London time).  If this time frame is not met, then component 
V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.  We had hoped to discuss this with 
you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support 
and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London 
requirement for officialized books.  

The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on 
what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread 
options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.  Those V@R calculations 
that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the 
component V@R calculations.  While there are other commodities that will 
currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less 
material than the UK spread options.  Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of 
days before this is completed.  Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of 
this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.  

I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the 
UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.  
We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.  It is 
probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and 
systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report 
earlier in the morning.  

Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or 
not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently 
meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.    ",2

Here's info you requested.  Per our conversation earlier, please try to 
arrange someone with experience/knowledge of Jornada device for training for 
Sally & me both.  Sally is not very technical & will need to be walked thru.  
If she doesn't learn how to properly use it, she will not use it, if you know 
what I mean.  Any help you can give me in setting up training w/ someone that 
will be able to answer our questions is greatly appreciated.  Please have

Too late with your spreadsheet.  The instructions that we got from Donna were 
that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then 
on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number 
of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by 
Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before 
leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to 
make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to 
take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening 
first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way 
back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of 
the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training 
class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I 
believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will 
pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this 
morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to 
cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  

Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the 
resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should 
make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the 
review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not 
practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you 
are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time 
frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from 
you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that 
would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.  
Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes 
of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not 
Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not 
simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to 
participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but 
we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and 
organizational work.  

I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program 
and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being 
critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.   

Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated ",2

Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between 
work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much 
to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and punch!  
Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I noticed some at 
a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)

Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week -

I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation 
study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.  
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the 
Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists 
and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne 
has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are 
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient 
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of 
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the 
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a 
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will 
detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.

I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.  

I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.  ",2

I thought that you might want to know that Randy Gay's wife passed away on 
Friday evening.  Randy is the Manager of the West Desk Gas Logistics group.  
His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved 
up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe.  
Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which 
resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.  Randy has a four 
year-old daughter.  

Several of us will be attending the funeral today.  Over the past several 
weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a 
fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic 
association.  Through donations from ENA employees, the original goal for the 
playground equipment was far exceeded.  ",2

The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice 
Presidents has been rescheduled several times.  Currently, this meeting is 
set for September 11 and 12.  Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice 
Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.  Assuming 
that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule 
your reviews sometime after September 12.  (Bob, I will assume that your 
review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process 
along with Peggy and Brent.)

On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for 
Vice President level and above.  You should all receive invitations to this 
event.  In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.  I do not know the

Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office 
in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought 
processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations 
personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.  
While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good 
option.  

I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After 
several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a 
practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no 
meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your 
document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a 
note then if there are any other comments that I have.  

I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while 
you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some 
concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my 
schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the 
calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he 
is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person 
sometime in the not too distant future.  

Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business 
controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a 
location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential 
dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a 
long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join 
us.  ",2

mid afternoon on Thursday.  Amanda's school open house is Thursday at 7:00, 
and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the

management team.  I will look forward to staying current with each one of you 
and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global 
Markets.  

I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the 
calendar going forward.  Although this new structure changes the direct line 
reporting relationship, I will continue to be very interested in the 
professional development of each of you.  I hope that we can schedule time 
together on an as needed basis.  ",2

If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the 
cruise, let me know.  My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on 
Wednesday night.  If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day 
for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.  This 
is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in 
response from others. But do let me know...",2

The record on Friday showed that 127 employees from Energy Operations had 
pledged dollars to the United Way campaign.  Large number, but still 
percentage-wise smaller than we would like.  I sent the message below to all 
Energy Operations employees on Friday afternoon.  We'll see in a few days if 
this helped on contributions.  

Text of e:mail message to Energy Operations employees:

Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that 
receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find 
out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused  
Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster 
parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to 
the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin 
and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were 
temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to 
have made that pledge.  

Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive 
matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit 
organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your 
charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time 
each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a 
difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an 
employee is matched by Enron.  

If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing 
so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next 
Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a 
pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron 
employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to 
http://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.

Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic 
pledge.    ",2

Sorry that I missed you this morning.  I attended that last Financial Council 
meeting on SAP this morning just prior to my lunch meeting with Mark Frevert 
and Rick Causey.  Nothing substantial came up on Helsinki, so it was fine 
that we didn't get to talk today.  I had wanted to be prepared on how to 
address out current activities there.  So I can get an update on that when we 
talk tomorrow.

I have a meeting on the analyst and associates program from 9:00 to 10:00 
tomorrow.   I will call you around 10:00 when I get back from that meeting.  ",2

Brent is in London this week, and will be on vacation the week of August 21.  
With the demands of a new role, Brent will be best able to address the 
feasibility of one or both of them attending.

Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran 
through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number.  
I think that I saw yours.  Did I miss you sometime this weekend?  With almost 
two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down 
the list in importance.  I an never quite sure that I get messages that 
anyone calls!  Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during 
my commute tonight again.  

Hope you had a good weekend.  Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and 
continuing the search for new clothes.  Our friend Mo was in town from London 
and had burgers with us on Saturday night.    --Sally ",2

I have been able to move up the meeting with Mark Frevert regarding 
responsibility for operations for ENA, EGM and EEL to Thursday, August 17 
instead of August 28.   I will keep you posted.  

I met with Brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced Brent's 
new role.  I will have three persons leading the natural gas team:  Steve 
Jackson, Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall.  I am confident that this will work 
well.  ",2
112,"
Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation 
schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.  ",2

Great job, as usual, on the United Way kick off today.  I saw Amy Leeand 
Eylesse Kalmans as I left the Hyatt and I told them.  Please pass the kudos 
along to the rest of your team.  The theme was timely, the staging was great, 
the questions on the gameshow were even educational for newer Enron 
employees, giving a little histsory and folklore about Enron.  (I knew the 
WLEC 1 answer!)  

I especially enjoyed the breakfast at Depelchin last Friday.  Their programs 
are important to all of us and the tour was very moving as we met some of the 
children in the shelter.  ",2

To all Energy Operations employees:

ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially 
proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.  
I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that 
you have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you 
for that.  

Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA 
and Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make 
sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and 
that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to ""take its pulse"" if you will; 
to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we 
could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the ""necessary tools"" 
and breaking down any ""barriers.""  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants 
who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will 
meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight 
our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, 
and the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.  
Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that 
input.  

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that only 
through open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  
Thank you.

The United Way Executive Solicitiation is underway.  You should have received 
an e:mail message about a week or ten days ago which let you know that you 
this year pledges should be made on line.  Mark Frevert reminded everyone at

you have not already done so, I would encourage you to complete your pledges 
before Tuesday.  Patti Thompson can tell you where to go on line to do this.

Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.  All VP's will be 
reviewed at an Enron-wide PRC scheduled for early August.  Representatives at 
that Enron PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato 
and Greg Piper.  They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in 
representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.  I have provided copies of your 
accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey 
for reference during that process.  

Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be 
completed before the end of July.  I will schedule an August date with you 
for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.  

Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact 
course that is required of VP's.  I thought that the course was very good.  
All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day 
course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.  I would contact 
Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.

Today was the final ENA PRC.  Relative ranking results up through the Senior 
Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process 
of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton 
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting 
the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should 
be the end of July.  

Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to 
announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.  
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not 
yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single 
memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you 
updated on this as I get direction from him.  

Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In 
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review 
process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when 
conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be 
consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups 
who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however, 
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view 
of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the 
Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that 
the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees 
performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory 
category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas 
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in 
the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.  

Also please note the following: 

Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or 
Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given 
to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with 
the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process 
for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process 
as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, 
yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced 
members of your management team, or those management team members where you 
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and 
perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time 
in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow 
through on this commitment.  

Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a 
meaningful one.

I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris  
County), and to my surprise I was selected to be a juror in a felony case.  
The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference 
call may not work.  I will try to reach you from my car while I am on my way 
in for jury duty - probably around 8:30 or 9:00 Houston time.  ",2

I would like to invite you as University of Oklahoma summer interns to join 
me for lunch on Friday, June 30.   I have made reservations for 11:45 am at 
Nino's on West Dallas.   I hope that you will be able to attend and can meet 
me in the Enron lobby at 11:30.  We will provide transporation to and from 
lunch.  Please call me at x35926 as soon as possible to let me know if you 
can attend. 

Mike McConnell, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks, 
will join us for lunch.  Many of you may have met Mike, a fellow OU grad.  He 
will serve as the Executive Lead for our continuing recruiting efforts at 
OU.  

Two other Enron employees will join us for lunch.  James Scribner, a Senior 
Director in ENA Energy Operations, recently joined Enron after seven plus 
years with a Fortune 500 company in Edmond, Oklahoma.  James will be helping 
us with our OU recruiting efforts.  Lexi Elliott, a new recruiter with 
Enron's Associates and Analysts Program, will be coordinating Enron's 
recruiting efforts in the future at OU.

I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on 
the MG aquisition and assimilation.  Would you please include me on that 
distribution list effective this week?   I believe that it is assumed that 
Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the 
aquisition is completed.  However, in my role over Global Risk Management 
Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of 
operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.  Brent Price, who reports 
to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping 
me updated on progress to date.  His return soon to Houston, however, will 
create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to 
fill.  

Thanks in advance to your attention to this.  ",2

time necessary to do a good job, but will also try to be time efficient.  
Patti has lunch and snacks ordered, so I would hope to be finished sometime

I interviewed Analyst/Associate candidates in the office on Saturday, as did 
four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations.   I completed 
the evaluations of the four candidates that I interviewed and submitted 
those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to 
commitments to attend a funeral.  I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he 
suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in 
Energy Operations.  

Analysts

Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams

Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my 
operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add 
more  strength to this group

Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants  to 
trade; would like to have him in risk to learn the business and Enron's risk 
books;  we  could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns 
Enron and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to 
a trading  role, if appropriate


Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work 
experience and fit)

Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two 
of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a 
direct hire

Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could 
be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience


Associates

Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group

Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who 
suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from  
Energy Operations interviewed him or her) 

Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not 
want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk 
or operations


Let me know about next steps in this process.  I would be glad to talk about 
any of this in more depth.  ",2
150,"
I got the memo from Naomi that you sent.  First, who is Doug Imrie?  Does he 
have a strong background in trading operations?  Will he be  able to 
coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able 
to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump 
start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort 
should be much broader than deal testing.  It should encompass assessing 
people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.  To do this quickly and 
effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading 
operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be 
the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in 
operations on a daily basis.  

Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in 
with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York 
offices.  From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is 
assume to have the US responsibility. Again, I don't know Andy.  

Should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that 
includes some others in the process, particularly those that have been 
involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily 
operational experience?  I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as 
well.  ",2
151,"
Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had 
earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that 
he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business.  
(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably 
what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will 
assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.  

Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely 
over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this 
business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with 
Jeff on this?   ",2
152,"
My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is 
sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the 
ballroom at the Rice.   Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, 
our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the 
common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit 
aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial 
reporting, etc.    In addition to managing these databases, Mary has 
harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an 
effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.  This tool can 
help measure and increase coverage by industry segments.  This project,  
Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is 
currently under development for delivery later this quarter.  

We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide 
who will attend the working session next week.  Please let me know if you are 
interested and if June 15 or June 16 fits your schedule.  

Thanks for considering this speaking opportunity.

Subject: Re: Enron Trading  

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. 


Thanks,
Wanda Curry

Wanda,

It was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to 
review my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When 
we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make 
sure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room 
for improvement later.

In addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the 
accounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do 
you plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.

Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.  Since 
Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him 
in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain 
a mention of the transition:

Example:

 Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be 
transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce 
assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will 
report to Barry effective with his start date in May.  

I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out 
of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading 
operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.  So sounds as if that 
is clarified.  ",2

Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our 
meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so 
it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  

Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became 
concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other 
supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily 
involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both 
recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting 
talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program. 

I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would 
bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss 
them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and 
improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included 
the following:

 Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU

 Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  

 Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida

 Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of 
Florida

 Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU

 Carolyn Barrett  EBS    

 Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P 


Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:

One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an 
announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much 
materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be 
managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw 
that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and 
differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We 
feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program 
on campus. 

SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is 
impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an 
innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates 
and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in 
May.  

Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed 
senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or 
communication about the program.   We hear rumors of ""tracks"", but no facts 
or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some 
had not.  

Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support 
staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily 
focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.

Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many 
of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join 
with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that 
decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum 
without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  

MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team 
and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on 
campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top 
candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the 
focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and 
we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.

We would love to see all three of you.  Sounds as if you might arrive on 
Friday around 5:00 or 6:00, so we will plan on dinner together.  You can see 
the kitchen in progress!!  The upstairs is untouched, however, so you can 
make yourselves at home.  I will let everyone know tonight, and they will all 
be glad to see you.  

I haven't talked with Cara since the weekend, so I didn't know that she might 
change her plans.  I will try to catch her tonight.  

Just let me know on the $'s.  I can send that whenever you might need it.  
And I would suggest that we start a repay program after another few months as 
you all get caught up on other things.  No rush.  

Love, Sally ",2

I tried to call you back today, but was told that you had left the office.  
Tried to leave you a voice mail message, but no one in the office knew how to 
transfer my call into voice mail.  They were good about answering your phone, 
however! 

I will call you tomorrow morning before my first meeting at 8:30.  If I miss 
you, I will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back.  I will be 
in meetings with operations people from London and Sydney tomorrow, but can 
easily step out to talk with you.  ",2

Per my voice mail message, attached is a draft memo regarding Brent's role in

Energy Operations has two sets of season tickets for Astros games this 
season.  One set is four tickets in the field box level, and the other set is 
two tickets in the terrace level.  I have also purchased one parking spot in 
a lot that is a couple of blocks from the stadium.  I have divided the 
tickets among you, with my husband's help.  He identified ""good games"" (i.e. 
teams that everyone likes to see), and those are distributed equally across 
my direct reports.  Tickets for the other games have been distributed based 
your percentage of Energy Operations employees.  For most games, you will 
receive all six tickets.  You can use these tickets for yourself and for a 
small reward for a job well done by someone in your group.  The parking 
information will accompany the group of four field box tickets.  Patti is 
including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed.  Your tickets 
will be distributed to you this week.  I hope that you and your staff will 
enjoy these.  

I also received over 100 tickets from Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave 
Delainey for the exhibition game on Saturday, April 1.  I have chosen to 
distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in Energy 
Operations who are not my direct reports.  SInce you will have first call on 
the season tickets going to your group, I thought that it would be nice to 
make these tickets available to the next tier of leadership.  I wanted to 
make you aware of this before these are distributed tomorrow.  

Finally, I have purchased a block of tickets for two upcoming games, one a 
weekday afternoon and one a weekend.  I will let you know these dates soon, 
as I would like for my direct report group to join me at these games. ",2

I am in London this week and have picked up your message with the 
attachment.  If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do 
with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.  Are you trying to 
create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in 
Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a 
position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use 
in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the 
risk books?  These three options would all require slightly different 
descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use 
this.  

Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you. ",2

Ted Murphy, Tom Bauer, Jim Brown and I met yesterday to schedule the next 
series of operations/controls reviews of Enron offices or certain companies 
in which Enron holds an ownership interest.   Attached is a copy of that 
schedule.  Please contact Ted or me if you have any questions.  You will note 
that the full make-up of the teams is being worked on currently.  We have 
identified the lead on each review, however, from RAC, Operations and AA.

I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday, March 15-17 to be with 
my children during part of their spring break.  We will be in town, so I can 
be reached either at home (281-370=8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591).  
I will check voice mail messages during this time period, but probably once 
or twice a day.  

I will be in the London office next week.  I will be in that office from 
about noon on Monday through the end of the day on Thursday.  Patti will have 
a schedule of my appointments while I am there, and she will have an 
international cell phone number that I will have with me throughout the 
trip.  Contact her if you need to speak directly with me.  I will be 
responding to voice mail frequently throughout the week.  I will be 
travelling back to Houston on Friday, March 24 (leaving my hotel in London 
around 1 AM Houston time).  

I will see you back in the office on Monday, March 27.  ",2

I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday this week (March 
15-17).   I will be with my children while they are on Spring Break.  I can 
be reached those three day either at home (281-370-8568) or on my cell phone

in the office while I am out:
Key Operations Contacts March 15-17

  Brent Price   Business Controller, Gas  x37647

  Kristin Albrecht   Business Controller, Power  x34763

Also, I will be in the London office during the week of March 20th.  I am 
working with Fernley Dyson and John Sherriff to structure training and 
orientation for a new head of trading operations that has been hired in 
London.  I am also working to provide transition resources to London for 
operational controls unttil the new guy is on board.  My work on this should 
be completed by the end of next week.  I will return to Houston on Friday, 
March 24.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106),  will have a copy of my 
schedule while I am in London as well as an international mobile phone number 
where I can be reached. Please don't hesitate to call.  I will be responding

1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John 
Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft 
now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he 
made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, 
meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive 
those drafts today.  

2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply 
to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was 
asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am 
there.    

3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are 
the following:

Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide 
for you during this transition period
Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of 
the details on having support personnel in London 

Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for 
Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one 
(which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)

Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is 
appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective 
trading operations and controls world-wide

I look forward to seeing you next week.  ",2
195,"
Attached is the list of PRC meetings that will cover operations for ENA, EIM 
and EGM.  Location, times and attendees are listed for each meeting.  There 
are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through 
December 5 in preparation for the Energy Operations PRC meeting that will be 
held on Friday, December 8.  I invite you to sit in on any or all of these 
meetings if you would like to do so.  

The most meaningful meeting will be on  December 8th.  In that meeting, we 
will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists 
and below.  I would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the 
preferred distribution is met as instructed, then this portion of the meeting 
will not take too long.  We will then review in more detail the managers, who 
will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings.  We will also review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  I can also be prepared to 
review my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me, with you, 
Wes Colwell and David Oxley in attendance.  

Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally

Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday 
morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.  

Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  
business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we 
would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good 
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron 
locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were 
focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on 
leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading 
operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be 
generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They 
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.  

 ",2
197,"
I didn't get a response from you regarding my e:mail that I sent last week, 
but I have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to 
Houston next week.  My plans for being in London next week are firm, so it 
looks as if we will miss one another.  

My offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role, so I 
trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed.  I will look forward 
to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide, 
with effective exception reporting.  This is a key initiative for 2000 and 
will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities.  
",2
198,"
Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week.  Wanted to see if 
you, Frank and Mo might be available for dinner one evening.  We arrive on 
Monday morning (March 20th) and will return to Houston on Friday morning.   
Our Tuesday night is booked, having dinner with Fernley.  But Monday, 
Wednesday and Thursday are available.  Does it work for you with the baby to 
do evenings?  Let me know.  ",2
199,"
The responsibility for granting access to the DPR and associated reports 
available through the Executive Viewer on line is being shifted from Scott 
Tholen's team to my operations team.   (This makes a lot of sense, since it 
is our group that prepares all of these reports.)  Fernley Dyson has 
requested access to this information via the Executive Viewer.  In insuring a 
tight distribution list for these reports, please let me know via return 
e:mail or voice mail (x35926) that you would like for Fernley to have access 
to the Enron-wide DPR.  Thanks. ",2

Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. 
The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. 
Transportation 
The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. 
Video 
You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge.

Enron Management Committee	

I hereby resign from the above mentioned committee.",3
55,"
Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  


As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  

UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  

Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:

1.	Transitional Steering Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.
Committee Members:
Mike Hutchins (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Louise Kitchen
Pat O'Donnell
Mike Bolin
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only.
Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST

2.	Integration Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  

Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Pat O'Donnell (co-chair)
Mark Bridges 
Sally Beck  - Operations
Mark Haedicke - Legal
Wes Colwell - Financial Operations
Bill Bradford - Credit
David Port - Market Risk
Jay Webb - IT
Jenny Rub - Infrastructure
Peter Keohane - Canada
David Forster - ubswenergy.com 
UBS counterparties
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate.
Time - Thursday 9:00am CST

3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

Proposed Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Tim Belden
Chris Calger
John Lavorato
Kevin Presto
Hunter Shively
Rob Milnthorp
Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required.
?Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002.

Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee.

3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee 
This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date.

Proposed Sub-Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Pat O'Donnell (co-chair)

Sally Beck  - Operations
Mark Haedicke - Legal
Wes Colwell - Financial Operations
Bill Bradford - Credit
David Port - Market Risk
Jay Webb - IT
Jenny Rub - Infrastructure
Peter Keohane - Canada
David Forster - ubswenergy.com 
Proposed Logistics:
This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded.
Time Tuesday 8:00am CST

3(ii)	Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee 
This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the UBS Warburg Energy Counterparties are capable of transacting with our new company in the shortest time possible and in the most efficient way for both the counterparty and UBS Warburg Energy.

* * * * * 
Tuesday, Dec. 4 
I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. 
* * * * *  ""Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too.""  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * 	
We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. 
Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. 
But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.

Can we discuss?

Firstly,  I never pick up voicemail so I just got your message from the week-end.  Sorry.

Anyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each.
It works - we have enough people to do it.

In terms of the Estate:
The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two EnronOnline environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for Enron - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the Enron estate.

In terms of NewCo:
EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff.

Everything has been somewhat confusing recently and I made a hasty decision to put you reporting through Legal (decision prompted by the community relations comment) - there will a dotted line into the desks.

I hope you are happy with this if not we can unwind but following many conversastions with them over the last few weeks - it really has been Lou Eber dealing with all the reg issues.  

I really believe that putting Reg in the legal area is the best choice to ensure your group doesn't fall down any cracks as it doesn't have a direct equivalent in  UBS.

Did you get your contract?

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

So far we have spent today relooking at our numbers for the whole business.  Technology is looking about the same as before (possibly 10 -  15 less in Jay's area).

This amused me this morning!

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, ""If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?""

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, ""Okay.""

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

""You have exactly 1,586 sheep here.""

The shepherd answers,

""That's correct, you can have your sheep.""

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

""If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?"" The young man
answers, ""Yes, why not?""

The shepherd says, ""You are an IT consultant.""

""How did you know?"" asks the young man.

""Very simple,"" answers the shepherd.

""First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?""",3

Can we have them until we move?  That would probably be the easiest time to give them up.

Just to clear up a mis-understsanding.

Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.

In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.
  
Thanks

Apart from the practicalities - Only Enron Canada and Enron Australia have the right to trade in the North American markets.  Australia is in bankruptcy and therefore in default of the cost sharing agreement - so we assume that's dead.  ECC is in the deal and selling its rights.   So as far as the exclusive for North America Gas and Power we are OK.  

The practical issues are still huge but I thought I'd tell you this.  No-one has rung me yet.",3

For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.

Hope this helps.

I thought it may be helpful to introduce Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  The attached document is a high level outline of what needs to be done between ourselves and the buyer.  

Should UBS be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name ""ubsenergy.com"".  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know. 

If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact Dave or myself, or on the form of the agreements Mark Taylor.

We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.
 
Thanks

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Any interest in chatting about a job at UBS?

Just when you thought it was safe............................

We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.  The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.

All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).

As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.

Thanks

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Product Side
+	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week
				Phase 2 - First Month
				Phase 3 - First Quarter

Target Number of Transactions
+	Phase 1
+	Phase 2
+	Phase 3

So I never got paid (expenses) for my tickets home.  Surprize!!!!!  So if I cancel - obviously as I didn't go.  Can I then reclaim the economy ones I booked for my parents and brother instead as I did not take my 2001 entitlement.  The tickets were all economy (4 x $1374:74).  A lot cheaper still than three business seats.

I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.

I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.

This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.

Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:

11/13/01	4,069:72
11/10/01	21,010:15
11/10/01	3,319:40

Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.

In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.

In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.

Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow.",3
