Guys, we are working to put together the final team to manage this issue; 
however, it isJeff Skilling's call to keep Delainey, Milnthorp and Keohane 
out of the day to day fray on this issue.  I believe this is the right call.  
Commercial and legal resources from Houston will manage this issue on a go 
forward basis and may call on you as a resource if needed from time to time. 
You have done a very great job managing this issue to date and your efforts 
on that front are much appreciated.  Our focus should return to growing the 
business and meeting our financial targets.

Peter, I believe that Mark H. would like you to stay involved through the 
Friday conference call that is scheduled.

Regards
Delainey"

I always have time for lunch!  I will ask my assistant to call you to set 
something up.  Thanks for your note.  --Sally "

Brent & Peggy,

Memo complete with exception of last paragraph write-up of your promotions.  
Sally made a beginning stab at it, but would like you to read over your 
segment and make any corrections or additions that you see fit (Peggy, in 
your case, can you fill in the blank).  When these are received back from 
you, I will call her (if it's this afternoon), and final copy will be 
distributed.  Thanks for your help.

Eric, we need more than $2M saving to get this deal to clear the hurdle.  I 
think we need to get to $350 to $400/kw firm including IDC to make this 
viable.  Please ensure that NEPCO is working to figure out the disconnect.

Regards

Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.

We recognize that we are experiencing a difficult time at Enron now and you are all interfacing with our customers every day.  We are therefore holding a  short meeting at 9:00am tomorrow morning to answer questions from you and your groups.  

Tammie to advise on the room.  Please invite all of your groups.
